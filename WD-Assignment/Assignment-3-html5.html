    <p><strong>2. How to embed audio and video in a webpage?</strong></p>
    <p>Ans. To embed audio in HTML, we use the < audio> tag. Before HTML5, audio cannot be added to web pages in the
            Internet Explorer era. To play audio, we used web plugins like Flash. After the release of HTML5, it is
            possible. This tag supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge in three audio formats – MP3, WAV, OGG.
            Only Safari browser doesn’t support OGG audio format.<br><br>

            To embed video in HTML, we use the < video> tag. It contains one or more video sources at a time using
                < source> tag. It supports MP4, WebM, and Ogg in all modern browsers. Only Ogg video format doesn’t
                    support in Safari browser.

    <p><strong>3. semantic element in HTML5?</strong></p>
    <p>Ans. Elements such as
        < header>, < footer> and < article> are all considered semantic because they accurately describe the purpose of
                    the
                    element and the type of content that is inside them.
                    <br><br>

                    example : < article>, < aside>, < footer>, < figure>, etc..

    <p><strong>4. Canvas and SVG tags.</strong></p>
    <p>Ans. SVG has better scalability. So it can be printed with high quality at any resolution<br><br>
        Canvas has poor scalability. Hence it is not suitable for printing on higher resolution <br><br>
        SVG gives better performance with smaller number of objects or larger surface.<br><br>
        Canvas gives better performance with smaller surface or larger number of objects.<br><br>
        SVG can be modified through script and CSS<br><br>
        Canvas can be modified through script only<br><br>
        SVG is vector based and composed of shapes.<br><br>
        Canvas is raster based and composed of pixel.</p>
