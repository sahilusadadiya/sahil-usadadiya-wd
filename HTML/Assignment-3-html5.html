    <p><strong>2. How to embed audio and video in a webpage?</strong></p>
    <p>Ans. To embed audio in HTML, we use the < audio> tag. Before HTML5, audio cannot be added to web pages in the
            Internet Explorer era. To play audio, we used web plugins like Flash. After the release of HTML5, it is
            possible. This tag supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge in three audio formats – MP3, WAV, OGG.
            Only Safari browser doesn’t support OGG audio format.<br><br>

            To embed video in HTML, we use the < video> tag. It contains one or more video sources at a time using
                < source> tag. It supports MP4, WebM, and Ogg in all modern browsers. Only Ogg video format doesn’t
                    support in Safari browser.

    <p><strong>3. semantic element in HTML5?</strong></p>
    <p>Ans. A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.<br>

        Examples of non-semantic elements:
        < div> and < span> - Tells nothing about its content.<br>

                Examples of semantic elements: < form>, < table>, and < article> - Clearly defines its content.
    </p><br>
    <strong>semantic tag name =></strong>
    < article>,< aside>, < detail>, < figure>, < mark>, < nav> , etc.

                            <p>Ans.=> svg tag:
                                The < svg> tag defines a container for SVG graphics. SVG has several methods for drawing
                                    paths, boxes, circles, text, and graphic images. To learn more about SVG, please
                                    read our SVG Tutorial.<br>
                                    canvas tag:
                                    The HTML < canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.<br>

                                        The < canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript
                                            to actually draw the graphics.
                            </p>
